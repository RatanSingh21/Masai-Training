-----------------------     Annotation based Configuration     ---------------------------

Spring framework used XML based configuration to manage beans and dependency injection. In XML configuration, beans are explicitly defined in an XML file, and their dependencies are wired through XML tags.

Annotations can be implemented at following levels:
    - Class
    - Method
    - Constructor
    - Attribute

Type of Annotations:
1. Stereotype Annotation: Define roles like service, repository, and component
    - @Service, @Repository, @Component, @Controller,
2. Autowiring Annotation: Does Dependency injections
    - @Autowired -- works only on non-primitive date type

Qualifier Annotation:
