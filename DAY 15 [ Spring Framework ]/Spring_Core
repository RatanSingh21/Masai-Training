Spring Modules:
    - Spring Core Module (IOC Container) : Base module for the rest
    - AOP Module (Aspect Oriented Programming) : Middleware service (not going learn)
    - MVC Module : Used for presentation layers (Spring MVC)
    - Test Module : Test modules

Spring Core Module:
    - Dependency [should be tried to make loosely coupled instead of tight coupling]
    - IOC [Inversion of Control ] - Design principle , IOC is managing all the dependency(instance of objects) and help to achieve loose coupling
    - DI
    - Java Bean [Should follow all 4 requirements -- public class, private attributes , no-args constructor and getter and setters]
    - Spring Bean [ A Spring Bean is an object managed by the Spring Container. Unlike Java Beans, Spring Beans do not necessarily have to follow all Java Bean conventions ]

1. IOC
    - IOC is a design principle where the control of object creation and dependency management is transferred from the program to an external container.
    - In Spring, IOC is implemented through the Spring Container, which manages the creation and assembly of beans.
    - Benefits:
        - Achieves loose coupling
        - Improves testability
        - Simplifies code maintenance

2. Bean Factory
    - BeanFactory( Interface which contains other useful interfaces) --- (Parent interface) ---- kindof deprecated.
    - One of the important interface is ApplicationContext Interface (child interface )of BeanFactory

3. Dependency Injection
    - The process by which an external entity (Spring Container) injects required dependencies into a class rather than the class creating them by itself.
    - Dependencies (what can be it)
        - Attribute type (int , float , primitive data type)
        - Object type
        - Collection type (list , map)
    - Type of dependencies
        - Setter Injection
        - Constructor


----------------------- Spring Boot ---------------------------

Annotations can be implemented at following levels:
    - Class
    - Method
    - Constructor
    - Attribute

Type of Annotations:
1. Stereotype Annotation
    - @Service, @Repository, @Component, @Controller,
2. Autowiring Annotation
    - @Autowired
3.
